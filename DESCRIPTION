Title: Tools to Obtain and Work with Cloud Provider CIDR Blocks
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2016-10-12

Description: Some cloud providers provide either an API or a file that contains all of the
    public networks that make up their cloud infrastructure. Many force you to obtain this
    data from publicly available internet routing registration data. Tools are provided that
    provide a standard API to obtain the network information for supported cloud providers.
    Each provider function returns processed, raw data structures that can be normalized
    with additional functions to enable predictable and consistent data formats for
    further processing.
